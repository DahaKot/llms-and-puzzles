  To solve any logic puzzle systematically, follow this adaptable framework:  

  ### **1. Classify the Puzzle Type**  
  Determine the core structure (e.g., deductive reasoning, sequencing, spatial arrangement, trivia, or riddles/wordplay).  

  ### **2. Analyze Clues**  
  - Break down explicit facts and implicit relationships.  
  - Translate ambiguous or complex statements into clear constraints.  

  ### **3. Select Tools & Strategies**  
  - **Logical/Deductive Puzzles**:  
    - Use elimination grids, mathematical comparisons, or conditional logic (*If X, then Y*).  
  - **Sequencing/Ordering**:  
    - Identify chronological, causal, or structural links (e.g., dates, pronouns, cause-effect).  
  - **Spatial/Seating Arrangements**:  
    - Sketch diagrams or tables to visualize positions and adjacency rules.  
  - **Trivia/Knowledge-Based**:  
    - Leverage cultural, historical, or contextual associations.  
  - **Riddles/Wordplay**:  
    - Decode abbreviations, homonyms, or thematic patterns.  

  ### **4. Test Hypotheses**  
  - Propose tentative conclusions and check for contradictions.  
  - Eliminate impossible options first.  

  ### **5. Validate Consistency**  
  - Ensure the final solution satisfies *all* clues without exceptions.  

  ### **6. Match to Answer Choices**  
  - Compare your conclusion to the provided options.  
  - Prioritize answers that align with *all* constraints, not just some.

deepseek_brainteasers: |
  **To solve logic puzzles and brain-teasers requiring structured analysis, apply this methodical approach:**  

  **1. Analyze Clues & Relationships**  
  - Identify **explicit elements** (objects, roles, constraints) and **implicit connections** (cause-effect, contradictions, dependencies).  
  - Map out logical sequences or hierarchies implied by the narrative (e.g., generational roles, spatial setups, symbolic metaphors).  

  **2. Identify Constraints & Patterns**  
  - Note contradictions or paradoxes in the scenario (e.g., overlapping roles, conflicting testimonies, physical impossibilities).  
  - Pinpoint recurring themes, wordplay, or double meanings (e.g., "chain gang" as both literal chains and collaboration).  

  **3. Evaluate Answer Choices**  
  - **Resolve Ambiguities**:  
    - Determine which option aligns with *all* constraints, including hidden premises (e.g., "four fathers" implies generational overlap).  
  - **Eliminate Mismatches**:  
    - Reject choices that conflict with critical details (e.g., bullet trajectory vs. suspect positioning) or fail to address paradoxes.  
  - **Validate Completeness**:  
    - Prioritize answers that explain *all* elements of the puzzle, not just isolated parts.  

  **4. Stress-Test Solutions**  
  - For each option, ask: *Does this account for every clue, resolve contradictions, and adhere to the puzzle's logical framework?*  

  **5. Prioritize Logical Consistency**  
  - Select the answer that leaves no unresolved gaps, even if counterintuitive. Avoid assumptions beyond the given data.

deepseek_cr: |
  **To solve critical reasoning puzzles involving paradoxes, assumptions, and conclusions, apply this structured approach:**  

  **1. Deconstruct the Argument**  
  - Identify the **stated premise(s)**, **unstated assumptions**, and **explicit conclusion**.  
  - Highlight paradoxes or contradictions in the reasoning (e.g., self-referential claims, circular logic).  

  **2. Evaluate Assumptions & Gaps**  
  - Question implicit premises that bridge evidence to conclusion (e.g., causality vs. correlation, hidden biases).  
  - Determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.  

  **3. Analyze Answer Choices**  
  - **Strengthen/Weaken**:  
    - Identify which option directly impacts the conclusion's validity by supporting/undermining assumptions or causal links.  
  - **Resolve Paradoxes**:  
    - Seek answers that reconcile conflicting evidence or clarify ambiguous premises.  
  - **Eliminate Distractors**:  
    - Discard choices that address irrelevant details, restate the premise, or introduce out-of-scope factors.  

  **4. Stress-Test Hypotheses**  
  - For each answer, ask: *Does this directly resolve the paradox, validate/break the assumption chain, or explain the conclusion's plausibility?*  

  **5. Prioritize Logical Precision**  
  - Select the option that most tightly aligns with the argument's core structure, avoiding tangential or partial solutions.

  **To solve logic puzzles involving analogies, sequences, or relational reasoning, apply this structured approach:**  

  **1. Identify Core Elements**  
  - Break down the problem into **key components** (e.g., terms, relationships, sequence rules).  
  - Clarify the **type of relationship** (categorical, functional, hierarchical) or **pattern** (positional, semantic, numerical).  

  **2. Determine Relationships/Patterns**  
  - For analogies, isolate the **primary link** (e.g., "Power : Watt" = concept : unit).  
  - For sequences, identify **transition rules** (e.g., letter shifts, semantic categories, embedded patterns).  
  - For relational puzzles, map **connections** (e.g., familial roles, cause-effect chains).  

  **3. Analyze Answer Options**  
  - **Test Consistency**: Check if each option aligns with the core relationship/pattern.  
  - **Eliminate Misfits**: Discard choices that violate the rule, introduce irrelevant factors, or misrepresent the relationship.  
  - **Resolve Ambiguities**: Prioritize answers that address *all* aspects of the problem (e.g., both term function *and* category).  

  **4. Stress-Test Logic**  
  - For each option, ask: *Does this maintain the structure of the original analogy, sequence, or relationship without introducing exceptions?*  

  **5. Prioritize Structural Precision**  
  - Select the answer that most directly and fully aligns with the problem's logic, avoiding partial or overcomplicated solutions.

deepseek_riddles: |
  **To solve metaphorical riddles requiring creative interpretation, apply this structured approach:**  

  **1. Decode Metaphorical Language**  
  - Identify **key metaphors**, **symbolic elements**, and **dual-meaning words** in each line.  
  - Break down abstract descriptions into literal or conceptual equivalents (e.g., "darkness" as ignorance, "light" as knowledge).  

  **2. Analyze Contradictions & Patterns**  
  - Highlight paradoxical phrases or conflicting imagery (e.g., "rises in darkness but rises in light").  
  - Look for repeating motifs, rhythmic patterns, or wordplay (e.g., homophones, hidden letters).  

  **3. Evaluate Answer Choices**  
  - **Literal vs. Symbolic**:  
    - Test whether options align with *both* literal clues and symbolic interpretations.  
  - **Resolve Paradoxes**:  
    - Prioritize answers that logically reconcile contradictions in the riddle's narrative.  
  - **Eliminate Distractors**:  
    - Reject choices that fit only surface-level clues or ignore critical metaphors.  

  **4. Stress-Test Interpretations**  
  - For each option, ask: *Does this explain all lines of the riddle, resolve its paradoxes, and align with its symbolic structure?*  

  **5. Prioritize Holistic Alignment**  
  - Select the answer that integrates the most clues cohesively, avoiding partial or forced solutions.

deepseek_parajumble: |
  **To solve parajumble puzzles requiring cause-effect analysis, apply this structured approach:**  

  **1. Identify the Core Narrative**  
  - Locate the **topic sentence** that establishes the central event, subject, or premise (often standalone and context-independent).  
  - Discern whether the paragraph is **chronological**, **problem-solution**, or **argument-evidence** structured.  

  **2. Map Cause-Effect Links**  
  - Highlight sentences with explicit causal language (*because, since, therefore, as a result*).  
  - Trace **actions** to their **consequences** and **reasons** to their **outcomes**, ensuring no gaps in logic.  

  **3. Track Chronology & Transitions**  
  - Note time markers (*first, later, finally*) and transitional phrases (*however, furthermore*).  
  - Prioritize sequences where events or ideas progress logically (e.g., problem → action → result).  

  **4. Resolve Pronouns & References**  
  - Link pronouns (*it, they, this*) to their **antecedents** in prior sentences.  
  - Identify contextual terms (*the decision, this process*) that depend on earlier explanations.  

  **5. Evaluate Coherence**  
  - Assemble a trial sequence and verify that each sentence **builds** on the prior one.  
  - Check for contradictions, abrupt shifts, or unresolved references.  

  **6. Eliminate Implausible Orders**  
  - Cross-check options against your reconstructed flow.  
  - Reject sequences where cause-effect chains break, pronouns lack antecedents, or chronology is violated.
