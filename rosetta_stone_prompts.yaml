deepseek_advanced: |
  Decipher the unknown sentence by systematically analyzing the parallel texts. Follow these steps:  

  1. **Analyze Parallel Sentences**:  
     - Review the provided **Parallel sentences** to identify consistent structural patterns (e.g., sentence length, word/symbol positions, punctuation).  
     - Detect repeated elements (words, symbols, numbers) across sentences and note their alignment.  

  2. **Establish Element Relationships**:  
     - Map recurring elements between known languages/texts (e.g., if a word appears in the same position in two sentences, hypothesize equivalence).  
     - Track frequencies and contextual usage to prioritize high-confidence matches.  

  3. **Develop Translation Rules**:  
     - Propose rules (e.g., substitutions, transliterations, grammatical transformations) that align elements between parallel sentences.  
     - Validate rules by checking consistency across all parallel examples. Revise if contradictions arise.  

  4. **Translate the Unknown Sentence**:  
     - Apply the validated rules to the **Sentence to translate**.  
     - Ensure the translation maintains structural coherence (e.g., word order, syntax) observed in the parallel sentences.  

  5. **Verify and Refine**:  
     - Cross-check the translated sentence against the original patterns.  
     - Adjust rules if the output conflicts with established relationships or lacks logical consistency.  

  **Input Data**:  
  **Parallel sentences**: 
    {data}
  **Sentence to translate**:
    {question}

  Focus on positional alignment, frequency analysis, and iterative validation to decode the unknown text.

deepseek_POSS: |
  Decipher the unknown sentence by systematically analyzing the possessive morphology patterns in the parallel texts. Follow these steps:  

  1. **Identify Possessive Components**:  
     - Examine the **Parallel sentences** to isolate the **possessor** (owner) and **possessed noun** (owned item) in both the source and target language.  
     - Note the order of the possessor and possessed noun (e.g., possessor first vs. possessed first) and any markers (affixes, particles, or word order) indicating possession.  

  2. **Map Morphological Patterns**:  
     - Compare equivalent phrases to determine how possession is marked (e.g., suffixes, prefixes, separate particles, or compounding).  
     - Identify how grammatical person (first, second, third), number (singular, plural), or noun class influence the possessive markers (e.g., "my" vs. "their").  

  3. **Derive Possession Rules**:  
     - Formulate rules for the target language's possessive structure (e.g., "In [Language], the possessor precedes the possessed noun, and ownership is marked with a suffix on the possessor").  
     - Validate rules by ensuring they apply consistently across all examples. Adjust if irregularities exist.  

  4. **Apply Rules to Translate**:  
     - Break down the **Sentence to translate** into the possessor and possessed noun based on the source language.  
     - Modify these components according to the target language's possessive rules (e.g., add affixes, adjust word order).  

  5. **Cross-Validate Translation**:  
     - Verify that the translated phrase aligns with possessive markers and word order observed in the parallel texts.  
     - Ensure grammatical agreement (person, number) matches established patterns.  

  **Input Data**:  
  **Parallel sentences**:  
  {data}  

  **Sentence to translate**:  
  {question}  

  Prioritize morphological logic, possessive agreement, and iterative validation to decode the correct structure.

deepseek_SEM: |
  Decipher the unknown semantic compounds by systematically analyzing morpheme alignment and meaning composition in the parallel texts. Follow these steps:  

  1. **Identify Semantic Units**:  
     - Examine the **Parallel sentences** to isolate root words, affixes, and modifiers in both the source and target language.  
     - Note how these units combine to form compound meanings (e.g., directional terms, possession markers, tense/aspect indicators).  

  2. **Map Meaning Relationships**:  
     - Compare equivalent phrases to determine how semantic units align across languages (e.g., a directional root in the source language might pair with a suffix in English).  
     - Highlight consistent compounding rules (e.g., modifiers precede roots, suffixes denote origin or directionality).  

  3. **Derive Composition Rules**:  
     - Formulate rules for how semantic units combine in the target language (e.g., "In [Language], directionality is marked by a suffix derived from the root term").  
     - Validate rules by ensuring they explain all provided examples. Adjust if mismatches occur.  

  4. **Apply Rules to Translate**:  
     - Deconstruct the **Sentence to translate** into its semantic components based on the source language's compounding logic.  
     - Reassemble these components using the target language's rules for meaning composition.  

  5. **Cross-Validate Translation**:  
     - Verify that the translated phrase preserves the original semantic relationships (e.g., direction, possession, intensity).  
     - Ensure affixes, modifiers, and roots align with the established compounding patterns.  

  **Parallel sentences**:  
  {data}  

  **Sentence to translate**:  
  {question}  

  Prioritize morpheme alignment, semantic consistency, and iterative validation to decode the correct compound meaning.

deepseek_ORDER: |
  Decipher the unknown sentence by systematically analyzing the word order patterns in the parallel texts. Follow these steps:  

  1. **Identify Core Components**:  
     - Examine the **Parallel sentences** to isolate the subject (S), verb (V), and object (O) in both the source and target language sentences.  
     - Note the relative positions of S, V, and O in each sentence pair (e.g., SVO, SOV, VSO).  

  2. **Map Structural Patterns**:  
     - Compare sentences of equivalent meaning to determine how S, V, and O align across languages (e.g., a subject in English might occupy a different position in the target language).  
     - Highlight consistent word order rules (e.g., adjectives follow nouns, tense markers precede verbs).  

  3. **Derive Syntactic Rules**:  
     - Formulate rules for the target language's word order (e.g., "In [Language], the verb follows the subject but precedes the object").  
     - Validate rules by ensuring they apply universally across all provided examples. Adjust if exceptions emerge.  

  4. **Apply Rules to Translate**:  
     - Break down the **Sentence to translate** into S, V, and O components based on the source language.  
     - Reorder these components according to the target language's syntactic rules.  

  5. **Cross-Validate Translation**:  
     - Verify that the translated sentence adheres to the word order patterns observed in the parallel texts.  
     - Ensure modifiers (e.g., adjectives, adverbs) and grammatical markers align with established positional rules.  

  **Input Data**:  
  **Parallel sentences**:  
  {data}  

  **Sentence to translate**:  
  {question}  

  Prioritize positional logic, syntactic consistency, and iterative validation to decode the correct word order.

deepseek_NOUN-ADJ: |
  Decipher the unknown sentence by systematically analyzing the structural relationship between nouns and adjectives. Follow these steps:  

  1. **Analyze Parallel Sentences**:  
     - Review the **Parallel sentences** to identify consistent patterns in noun-adjective order.  
     - Note whether adjectives precede or follow nouns in the target language by comparing word positions to their English translations.  

  2. **Establish Word Relationships**:  
     - Map recurring adjectives and nouns across sentences (e.g., if "kümé" aligns with "good" in multiple examples, classify it as an adjective).  
     - Confirm consistency: Verify if the same word retains its role (noun/adjective) across all contexts.  

  3. **Determine Word Order Rule**:  
     - Deduce the target language's grammatical rule: Does it use **noun + adjective** or **adjective + noun** order?  
     - Cross-validate this rule against all parallel sentences to ensure no exceptions exist.  

  4. **Apply the Rule to Translate**:  
     - For the **Sentence to translate**, first identify the noun and adjective based on established relationships.  
     - Arrange them according to the target language's confirmed word order.  

  5. **Validate and Refine**:  
     - Check if the translated sentence aligns structurally with all parallel examples.  
     - If conflicts arise, re-examine word roles or adjust the proposed order rule.  

  **Input Data**:  
  **Parallel sentences**: 
    {data}
    
  **Sentence to translate**:
    {question}

  Focus on positional patterns, role consistency, and rule validation to decode the correct noun-adjective order.
