  You are a cryptic crossword expert. You are given a cryptic crossword clue.
  A cryptic clue typically consists of a definition and a wordplay. The definition is a synonym of the answer and usually appears at the beginning or the end of the clue. The wordplay provides instructions for deriving the answer in a less literal way. The number(s) in parentheses at the end of the clue indicate the length of the answer.
  Extract the definition and the wordplay from the clue, then use them to solve it. Finally, provide the answer in the format "Answer: ...".

  Analyze the cryptic clue by following these steps:  
  1. **Identify Components**: Split the clue into its *definition* (usually at the start or end) and *wordplay* (the cryptic element).  
  2. **Check for Common Cryptic Types**:  
     - **Anagram**: Look for words like *mixed, chaotic, broken*. Rearrange letters.  
     - **Charade**: Combine parts of words (e.g., *'fish' + 'ing' = 'fishing'*).  
     - **Hidden Word**: Find a word concealed within the clue (e.g., *'part of *castle*' = 'cast'*).  
     - **Reversal**: Words like *back, returning* hint at reversing letters (e.g., *'flow' reversed = 'wolf'*).  
     - **Homophone**: Words like *heard, sounds like* indicate similar-sounding words.  
     - **Container/Insertion**: Words like *holding, inside* suggest inserting letters (e.g., *'anger' holding 'v' = 'vanger'*).  
     - **Deletion**: Words like *losing, without* signal removing letters.  
  3. **Parse Abbreviations/Symbols**: Convert parts of the clue into abbreviations (e.g., *'queen' = Q, 'heart' = ♥ = 'art'*).  
  4. **Double Definitions**: Check if the clue offers two distinct meanings for the answer.  
  5. **Verify Answer**: Ensure the solution matches both the definition and wordplay, and fits the required letter count (if provided).  

  **Clue:**
  {clue}
  **Final Output**: Clearly state the answer and explain how each component (definition + wordplay) leads to it.

deepseek_anagram: |
  To solve this cryptic anagram clue, follow these steps:  
  1. **Identify the definition**: This is the part of the clue that directly describes the answer (often at the start or end).  
  2. **Locate the anagram indicator**: Look for words suggesting rearrangement, such as "change," "breaking," "shocking," "ridiculous," or "awkward."  
  3. **Extract the letters**: Take the remaining words (excluding the definition and indicator) and combine their letters. Ignore punctuation and spaces.  
  4. **Rearrange the letters**: Form a word or phrase that matches the definition and has the specified letter count (provided in parentheses).  

  **Clue:**
  {clue}
  **Answer:**

deepseek_short_anagram: |
  To solve a cryptic anagram clue, first identify the definition (often at the start or end of the clue) and the wordplay. The wordplay will include an anagram indicator (e.g., "change," "shocking," "awkward") and a set of letters to rearrange. Extract the letters from the wordplay portion, ignoring punctuation and spaces, then anagram them to form the solution. Ensure the resulting word matches the definition in both meaning and length. Verify that all letters are used exactly once.  

  **Clue:**  
  {clue}  
  **Answer:**

deepseek_assemblage: |
  To solve this cryptic *assemblage* clue, follow these steps:  
  1. **Identify the definition**: This directly defines the answer, typically at the start or end of the clue.  
  2. **Locate wordplay components**: Look for:  
     - **Extractions** (e.g., "fourth of X" = the 4th letter of X, "beginning" = first letter).  
     - **Synonyms** (e.g., "transport" = *vehicle*).  
     - **Abbreviations** (e.g., "prize" = *E* for "excellence").  
     - **Hidden words** or letters at intervals (e.g., "at regular intervals" = every other letter).  
     - **Reversals** (e.g., "returning" = reverse a substring).  
  3. **Break down each component**: Extract letters, substitute synonyms, apply abbreviations, or reverse segments as indicated.  
  4. **Assemble the parts**: Combine the elements to form the answer, ensuring the total length matches the number in parentheses.  

  **Clue:**
  {clue}
  **Answer:**

deepseek_short_assemblage: |
  To solve the cryptic clue, first identify the definition (often at the start or end) and the wordplay. Parse the wordplay for components like synonyms, abbreviations, letter positions (e.g., "fourth of X"), removals (e.g., "doesn’t start"), reversals, or hidden words. Combine these elements logically to form the answer, ensuring it aligns with the definition and letter count.  

  **Clue:**  
  {clue}  
  **Answer:**

deepseek_container: |
  To solve this cryptic *container* clue, follow these steps: 
  1. **Identify the definition**: Determine the part of the clue that directly defines the answer, usually positioned at the beginning or end.  
  2. **Spot insertion indicators**: Look for words or phrases like "in," "around," "holding," "encased," or "invested in," which signal that one substring (*contained*) is nested inside another (*container*).  
  3. **Break down components**:  
     - **Container**: Identify the outer substring (often a synonym, abbreviation, or truncated word).  
     - **Contained**: Locate the inner substring to be inserted (check for synonyms, abbreviations, or wordplay like reversals).  
  4. **Assemble**: Insert the *contained* substring into the *container*, ensuring proper letter order.  
  5. **Verify length**: Confirm the total letters match the number in parentheses.  

  **Clue:**
  {clue}
  **Answer:**

deepseek_short_container: |
  To solve a cryptic container clue, identify words indicating insertion (e.g., "kept by," "in," "around"). Split the clue into two parts: the *container* (which surrounds) and the *containee* (which is inserted). Combine them by placing one part inside the other, ensuring the total letters match the answer length. Check for abbreviations, synonyms, or hidden words in either component.  

  **Clue:**  
  {clue}  
  **Answer:**

deepseek_double definition: |
  To solve a cryptic double definition clue, follow these steps:  

  1. **Identify the two definitions**: Split the clue into segments that represent *two distinct meanings* of the same word.  
  2. **Consider homonyms and polysemes**: Look for a word with separate definitions (e.g., differing parts of speech, alternate pronunciations, or unrelated meanings).  
  3. **Match the letter count**: Ensure the answer aligns with the specified length (provided in parentheses).  
  4. **Verify mutual fit**: Confirm the word logically satisfies *both* definitions without relying on wordplay (e.g., anagrams or hidden words).  

  **Clue:**
  {clue}
  **Answer:**

deepseek_short_double definition: |
  A cryptic double definition clue requires a single word answer that has two distinct meanings. Each part of the clue directly hints at one of these meanings, and the answer must align with both definitions simultaneously. Consider the word's spelling, length (indicated in parentheses), and how both parts of the clue independently point to the same term. Analyze each segment of the clue to identify the dual-purpose word that satisfies both definitions.  

  **Clue:**  
  {clue}  
  **Answer:**

deepseek_hidden word: |
  To solve this cryptic *hidden word* clue, follow these steps:  
  1. **Identify the definition**: This directly defines the answer, often positioned at the start or end of the clue.  
  2. **Locate hidden indicators**: Look for terms like "kept by," "from," "in," "offering," or "contained in" that signal letters are embedded within adjacent words.  
  3. **Analyze the text as a continuous string**: Ignore spaces and punctuation. Search for a consecutive sequence of letters matching the specified length (in parentheses), which may span multiple words.  
  4. **Confirm the answer**: Ensure the extracted letters align with the definition and length requirement.  

  **Clue:**
  {clue}
  **Answer:**

deepseek_short_hidden word: |
  To solve the cryptic clue, first isolate the definition, which directly describes the answer. The wordplay component will indicate that the answer is embedded as a consecutive sequence of letters within one or more adjacent words in the clue. Carefully scan the text for hidden letter strings that match the definition and specified length. Confirm the answer by aligning both the definition and the concealed letter structure.
